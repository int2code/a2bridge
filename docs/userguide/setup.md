# Setup

## Windows setup

By default, Windows OS cannot transmit more than 2 output channels to
the output. To use more than 2 output channels additional drivers need
to be installed (Check [Download – ASIO4ALL Official
Home](https://asio4all.org/about/download-asio4all/)). After
installation of additional drivers, it can be used in programs like
Audacity or ocenaudio.

## Linux setup

Linux is able to handle multiple channels without any additional drivers installed.
